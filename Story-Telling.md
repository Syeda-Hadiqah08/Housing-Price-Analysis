# **üè† Housing Price Analysis Project**

Analyzed a Housing dataset (acquired from Kaggle) consisting of property prices, areas, bedroom counts, and furnishing statuses. Key Findings are:
- The average house price and area showed considerable variability, with standard deviations suggesting significant market inconsistency.
- Most properties had moderate sizes and prices, but some large homes appeared at unexpectedly lower prices, possibly due to location or outdated conditions.
- The histograms revealed that both area and price distributions are right-skewed, indicating a few very large or expensive properties pushing the average higher.
- Box plots highlighted distinct outliers in both area and price, reinforcing the spread seen in histograms.
- The scatter plot comparing price and area, colored by furnishing status, showed a general upward trend‚Äîlarger homes typically cost more. Interestingly, furnished houses tended to cluster in the higher price range even for similar areas, indicating the added value of furnishing.
- These patterns suggest a mixed and dynamic housing market where both size and features like furnishing play key roles in price determination.
